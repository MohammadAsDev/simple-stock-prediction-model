# Stock Prediction

This is a simple project, that try to predict stock price, it will use __LSTM Sequential Model__
with some regularization techniques (i.e. Dropout) to prevent overfitting,
i tried to use the traditional error metric __(MSE)__, with adaptive learning algorithm __(i.e. admam or Ada)__

***

This model is linked with web application so we can represent the reults that we get.
